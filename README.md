# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
Exploratory Data Analysis is the main goal of this project.

## Process
### Create a new database called ecommerce and import data from csv files into database.
### Data cleaning
### Data analysis

## Results
The analysis of the data revealed the distribution of product purchases over countries and cities.
Popularity of product categories over countries and cities was also observed.
The amount of visitors per channel can also be seen from analysis of the data. 

## Challenges 
The greatest challenge was having to spend most of the time transforming and cleaning the data. The data contains highly improperly structured data, duplicates, nulls.

## Future Goals
1. Review the normaliztion of the tables.
2. Find answers to more questions to gain deeper insights into the dataset.
